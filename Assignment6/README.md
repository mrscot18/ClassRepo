This program allows for you to choose a selection of options
You can play rock paper scissors or input your hometwon (two from part 1 of assignment)
Or you can play "Guess that song!" The one I created for part 2.
I was able to create a rock paper scissors game, enter in a hometown, and guess a lyric game.
I was not able to do the third part of the assignment (10 point part).
I am able to run this code on the terminal with gradle. 

In order to run this code you must:

First terminal: gradle runRegistry
Second terminal:  gradle runNode
Third Terminal: gradle runClient

When your client boots up youll have 3 options: 

option 1 = Rock, Paper Scissors. 
    This will tell you if youve won or tied in the node window. 
option 2 = Adding in your hometown to a list
option 3 = Playing "Guess that song!" Where youll be presented with a lyric that youll have to type in the right song title. 
    there is little error handling for the answer for the song lyric, so youll have to input it correctly. 


*For my protos I used some help from the SER321Examples and used protos throughout there to help. However, I built the song.proto
